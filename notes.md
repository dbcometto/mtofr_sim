Architecture landed on today (after several deliberate reframes):

World — owns Environment + agents dict, runs the tick loop: agents update (issue/poll tasks) → environment steps physical dynamics
Agent — holds a mission graph, memory, and per-primitive task handles. Never touches WorldState — only issues capability requests and reads status. Translates IPL primitive types (move_to, avoid) into platform-specific capability names via platform.capabilities(), so Agent stays fully platform-agnostic
Platform (BicycleUGV) — owns physical state, runs its own internal MPC (scipy.optimize.minimize, warm-started) to compute controls each tick based on whatever tasks are currently active. Exposes actuate/poll_status/cancel (async-style, even though currently synchronous) plus persistent avoid regions
Environment (GroundPlaneEnv) — infinite plane, no bounds/collisions, just steps each platform's dynamics
Memory — per-agent typed store (currently Location), private per platform (no shared ground truth between agents)
viz (PlanePlotter) — live matplotlib position + heading arrow, headless-mode toggle in main.py

Mission representation: graph-based — nodes hold multiple primitives, edges hold explicit conditions referencing specific primitive indices and required statuses (e.g. {"primitive": 1, "status": "success"}). Replaced an earlier flat-list version once concurrency/multi-primitive needs became clear.

Key design principles established:

Continuous capabilities (move_to, avoid) are persistent platform state feeding one combined MPC cost — not independent per-primitive control outputs
Discrete capabilities use actuate/poll/cancel with success/fail/timeout, modeled loosely on ROS-action-style semantics but kept custom/minimal for now
Platform reports task-completion status; Agent only reasons about status, never raw physical state
LLM will write DSL (not raw Python/dicts); a compiler layer validates and translates DSL → the graph structure Agent consumes — keeps LLM output safely inspectable/rejectable before reaching hardware
The graph itself is a candidate artifact for human-commander review/approval — directly supports the thesis's human-oversight claim

Known open items, deferred intentionally:

avoid-as-mission-node is mechanically working but conceptually awkward (fires as a normal primitive with no real "done" state; a cleaner separate mechanism may be warranted later)
No validation layer yet for LLM/DSL-generated graphs (primitive indices, capability names) — designed for, not built
Only one platform type and one environment exist — abstraction boundaries are unvalidated by a second real implementation
No multi-agent test yet, despite World/Agent architecture supporting it in principle
The actual thesis comparison (structured vs. unstructured mission execution on reliability/adaptability/coordination/oversight) hasn't started

Assessment: solid, working foundation consistent with the thesis direction — genuine architectural validation happened today, but this is infrastructure, not yet evidence for the thesis claim itself.




## Pre-notes 8 Aug 26
(Written by Claude)

The system must control a robot in two different ways. Some actions are continuous. The optimal controller must move the robot toward a goal. Other actions are discrete. The robot must do the action one time, not gradually. The system must not try to blend these two types into one method. Each method must handle only the type of action it can control well. *MTOFR just puts the robot at the right place at the right time and signals for an action*

The mtofr system must not control hardware directly. The mtofr system must decide where the robot must be and when the robot must act. The mtofr system must send a command to another process to perform the action. The other process must control the camera, the gripper, or other hardware. This separation must keep mtofr simple. This separation must also let other hardware programs change without changes to mtofr.

An action may take time to finish. The mtofr system must start the action and then check its status. The status must be "waiting", "success", "fail", or "timeout". The mtofr system must also be able to cancel an action before it finishes. This capability is necessary if a higher priority task must interrupt the current action. The team must build a simple version of this system first. The team may build a more complex version, like a graph structure, at a later time.

**Working:** Full sim loop runs live: `World.step()` → agents plan → env steps dynamics → mission update → viz renders position + heading arrow. Ctrl+C to exit.

**Package layout** (`src/mtofr/`, editable install):
- `world/base.py` — `WorldState`, `Platform` (ABC), `Environment` (ABC)
- `world/world.py` — `World` (owns env + agents, sequences plan→dynamics→mission)
- `world/ground_plane/env.py` — `GroundPlaneEnv` (infinite plane, no bounds/collisions)
- `world/ground_plane/platforms.py` — `BicycleUGV` (kinematic bicycle model, vel+steer control)
- `agent/agent.py` — `Agent` (wraps platform + memory + mission_state; `plan` returns fixed controls set at construction; `update_mission` is a no-op stub)
- `memory/memory.py` — `Memory` (typed key-store), `Location`
- `viz/plane_plotter.py` — `PlanePlotter` (live matplotlib dot + heading arrow per agent)
- `main.py` (repo root) — wires one `BicycleUGV` + `Agent` + `Memory` into a `World`, runs fixed-timestep loop with drift monitoring

**Not yet built:**
- `Primitive` base + `Visit` (next planned step — will reference `Memory`'s `Location` entries)
- Real `plan()` logic (currently hardcoded constant controls)
- Mission state schema / actual mission tracking
- Comms/SSH layer, OPORD→primitive pipeline, object database — all deferred

**Known open questions / soft spots:**
- No validation that `controls` dict has an entry for every agent each tick (silent `KeyError` risk once >1 agent)
- `collides`/bounds concept dropped entirely for now (infinite world, no obstacles)
- Follow-type primitives will need cross-agent info flow (comms/perception) since each agen
